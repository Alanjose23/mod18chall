# USER API

## Description
This is a user API that functions as a social network for people and individuals to connect and socialize with with their thoughts and think and broadcast their ideas out loud. I created this to run as an api with insomnia to add, delete, post, and get user and thought information from an api. This uses MongoDb and uses the connection to connect to a database and uses a port in local storage to do so. The biggest challenge for me was to implement and create the api with the use of the controllers, as I could not get thoughts to populate, only an empty array.
